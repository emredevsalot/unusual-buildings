# Unusual Buildings
Unusual Buildings is a showcase of extraordinary and unique architectural wonders from around the world. I wanted to show my skills in creating a **multi-page application with smooth animations**.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a flexible and efficient way to create dynamic web applications.
- **react-router-dom**: The react-router-dom library is utilized to handle routing and navigation within the application. It enables seamless navigation between different pages and facilitates passing URL parameters for channel selection.
- **Framer Motion**: An animation library for React that facilitates the creation of smooth and visually captivating animations and transitions throughout the site.

## Lessons Learned
- Understanding and implementing **routing** in React using react-router-dom.
- Integrating **animations and transitions** effectively using the framer-motion library.
- Creating **reusable** components to maintain a consistent design and code structure.
- **Managing state** and data flow in a multi-page application using React's component-based architecture.
